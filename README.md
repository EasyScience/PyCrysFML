## Installing

### Standard installation

The pycrysfml python package is currently in beta testing, with pre-releases being published on our own PyPi server. To test it, please install it using the PIP package manager with additional option as shown below.

* Create and activate a python environment (_optional_)

  ***macOS and Linux***

  ```
  python3.11 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

  ***Windows***

  ```
  python3.11 -m venv .venv
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

* Upgrade the package installer for Python (_optional_)

  ```
  pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

* Install pycrysfml using a link to our own online repository

  ```
  pip install pycrysfml --extra-index-url https://easyscience.github.io/pypi/
  ```

### Installation from source

If the standard installation doesn't work for you, try building pycrysfml locally and installing it from the generated Python wheel.

* Create and activate a python environment (_optional_)

  ***macOS and Linux***

  ```
  python3.11 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

  ***Windows***

  ```
  python3.11 -m venv .venv
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

* Upgrade the package installer for Python (_optional_)

  ```
  pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

* Install Python dependences, including extras (ci and test)

  ```
  pip install '.[ci,test]'
  ```

* Print possible options for creating job scripts (_optional_)

  ```
  python pybuild.py --help
  ```

* Create job scripts with default options

  ```
  python pybuild.py --create-scripts

## How to use

### Compute the powder diffraction pattern

Here is the simplest example of using pycrysfml to calculate a powder diffraction pattern from a Python dictionary, which contains a description of the crystallographic phase as well as parameters related to the instrument and experiment.

Install the matplotlib package used in the example below:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

Run this example [srtio3-pattern-simulation.py](examples/pyCFML/cfml_utilities/powder_pattern_from_json/srtio3-pattern-simulation.py) to see the simulated powder diffraction pattern:

```
python examples/pyCFML/cfml_utilities/powder_pattern_from_json/srtio3-pattern-simulation.py
```

More features will be added as the project develops.
